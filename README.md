## Legend Active Volume Analysis
This repository contains the scripts used to determine the Active Volume (AV) of the LEGEND ICPC germanium detectors. 
The analysis is divided up by radioactive source used for the characterisation - e.g. Ba-133, Am-241. Note that currently only the Ba-133 analysis has been completed. 

The data used in this analysis is the HADES characterisation data, which is stored at MPIK. We are using the <code>pygama</code> processed data.

The MC simulations used are generated by <code> legend-g4-simple-simulation </code>, which automatically generates raw MC spectra and AV postprocessing, according to a given config file. These are also stored at MPIK.
